# Big List of Naughty Strings
The Big List of Naughty Strings is a list of strings which have a high probability of causing issues when used as user-input data. This is intended for use in helping both automated and manual QA testing.

The list consisted of newline-delimited strings and comments which preceded with `#`. The comments divide the strings into sections for easy manual reading.
